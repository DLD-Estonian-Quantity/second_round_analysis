In this folder, we provide the data and code utilized for 1) constructing linear mixed models (LMM) and 2) calculating group mean differences and correlations.  The abbreviations used in the file names are defined as follows:

a) modeling (data = modeling_reduced)
p_code = participant code
p_no = participant number
mmr_dev32 = MMRs for the difficult deviant
mmr_pos_neg = MMRs for the easy deviant
time = measuremnt at time 1 or 2
tw = MMR in time-window 1 or time-window 2
age1 = age at first measurement
group = group status dld (developmental language disorder) , td (typical development)
b1_2 = d'score of the first behavioral task
b2_2 = d'score of the second behavioral task
lang = overall language test score

b) other statistics (data = var, var_t1, therapy)
p_code = participant code
sex = f (female), m (male)
group = group status dld (developmental language disorder) , td (typical development)
age1 = age at first measurement
mot.edu = maternal education level: basic (basic education level), sec (secondary education level), voc (vocational education), high (higher education)
hand = r (right), l (left)
lang = overall language test score
int = non-verbal intelligence tasks combined score
b1_2 = d'score of the first behavioral task at T2 (second measurement)
b1_2_rt = reaction time of the first behavioral task  at T2
b2_2 = d'score of the second behavioral task at T2
b2_2_rt = reaction time of the second behavioral task  at T2
b1_2_q12 = mistakes discriminating between quantity 1 and 2 in the first behavioral task at T2
b1_2_q13 = mistakes discriminating between quantity 1 and 3 in the first behavioral task at T2
b1_2_q23 = mistakes discriminating between quantity 2 and 3 in the first behavioral task at T2
b2_2_q12 = mistakes discriminating between quantity 1 and 2 in the second behavioral task at T2
b2_2_q13 = mistakes discriminating between quantity 1 and 3 in the second behavioral task at T2
b2_2_q23 = mistakes discriminating between quantity 2 and 3 in the second behavioral task at T2
mmr_diff_t1 = mean mmr of the difficult deviant at T1 (first measurement)
mmr_diff_t2 = mean mmr of the difficult deviant at T2 
mmr_easy_t1 = mean mmr of the easy deviant at T1 
mmr_easy_t2 = mean mmr of the easy deviant at T2 
b1_1 = d'score of the first behavioral task at T1 
b1_1_rt = reaction time of the first behavioral task at T1 
b2_1 = d'score of the second behavioral task at T1 
b2_1_rt = reaction time of the second behavioral task at T1 
b1_1_q12 = mistakes discriminating between quantity 1 and 2 in the first behavioral task at T1
b1_1_q13 = mistakes discriminating between quantity 1 and 3 in the first behavioral task at T1
b1_1_q23 = mistakes discriminating between quantity 2 and 3 in the first behavioral task at T1
b2_1_q12 = mistakes discriminating between quantity 1 and 2 in the second behavioral task at T1
b2_1_q13 = mistakes discriminating between quantity 1 and 3 in the second behavioral task at T1
b2_1_q23 = mistakes discriminating between quantity 2 and 3 in the second behavioral task at T1
m_epoch = usable EEG epochs at T2

m_epoch1 = usable EEG epochs at T1

therapy = attendence in therapy in minutes during the one year between T1 and T2
